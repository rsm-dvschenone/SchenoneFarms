    "section": "",
    "text": "Ernie Schenone Jr. is a fourth-generation farmer, born and raised in the agricultural heart of Linden, California. With roots buried deep in the Central Valley soil, Ernie grew up working in the orchards before pursuing his education and broadening his perspective.\nAfter earning a Mechanical Engineering degree from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and later an MBA from the University of San Diego, Ernie returned to the land that shaped him. A true entrepreneur, risk taker, and hands-on leader, he embodies both tradition and forward-thinking.\nErnie took over Schenone Farms from his late father, Ernie Schenone Sr., and has since carried the family legacy forward with grit, grace, and gratitude. As a family man and farmer at heart, he’s proud to continue nurturing the land that has supported his family for generations.\n\n\n\nAt Schenone Farms, we specialize in sweet cherries — especially Coral Champagnes — and California-grown walnuts. These are more than crops to us — they’re the result of long days, careful planning, and a deep respect for the land.\nWe believe in: - Hard work\n- Community service\n- Farming with integrity\nFrom our orchards to your kitchen, we’re proud to deliver the very best of Linden.\n\n\nThank you for supporting family farms."
