**Ernie Schenone Jr.** is a fifth-generation farmer, born and raised in the agricultural heart of **Linden, California**. With roots buried deep in the Central Valley soil, Ernie grew up working in the orchards before pursuing his education and broadening his perspective.

After earning a **Mechanical Engineering degree from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo**, and later an **MBA from the University of San Diego**, Ernie returned to the land that shaped him. A true entrepreneur, risk taker, and hands-on leader, he embodies both tradition and forward-thinking.

Ernie took over **Schenone Farms** from his late father, **Ernie Schenone Sr.**, and has since carried the family legacy forward with grit, grace, and gratitude. As a family man and farmer at heart, he’s proud to continue nurturing the land that has supported his family for generations.

## What We Grow {.mt-4}

At Schenone Farms, we specialize in **sweet cherries** — especially **Coral Champagnes** — and **California-grown walnuts**. These are more than crops to us — they’re the result of long days, careful planning, and a deep respect for the land.

We believe in:
- Hard work
- Community service
- Farming with integrity

From our orchards to your kitchen, we’re proud to deliver the very best of Linden.
